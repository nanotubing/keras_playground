# managing python and r scripts used to learn keras and tensorflow  
for my Capstone Project at [Temple University](https://bulletin.temple.edu/graduate/scd/cla/geographic-information-systems-psm/)
I am investigating the use of Keras and Tensorflow in Python to perform image
classification on Satellite Imagery in Colombia. This is a repository for code I'm using for the classification. The full report of this work will be documented on [my personal website](https://claudeschrader.com)

This code is based on a fantastic [unet example](https://github.com/reachsumit/deep-unet-for-satellite-image-segmentation) designed for performing image segmentation on satellite imagery. Thanks to @reachsummit
